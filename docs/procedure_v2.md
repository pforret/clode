Yes, this experimental workflow is a perfect use case for Git. You'll use a **feature branch** to isolate your work, regular **commits** as your checkpoints, `git reset` to go back, and an **interactive rebase** to combine everything into one final, clean commit.

Here is a step-by-step guide with the corresponding Git commands.

-----

### 1\. Start: Create a Feature Branch üå±

First, create a new branch from your `main` branch. This isolates your experimental code and ensures `main` remains clean.

```bash
# Make sure you are on the main branch and it's up to date
git switch main
git pull

# Create a new branch for your feature and switch to it
git switch -c feature/my-new-idea
```

You are now on the `feature/my-new-idea` branch, and any changes you make will not affect `main`.

-----

### 2\. Work & Create Checkpoints üíæ

As you and your AI assistant work, you'll make changes. When you reach a good point that you might want to return to, create a "checkpoint" by making a commit. The commit messages for these can be simple and temporary.

```bash
# After some files are changed, added, or deleted...
# Stage all changes for your checkpoint.
git add .

# Create the checkpoint with a simple message.
git commit -m "Checkpoint 1: Initial component structure"

# ...continue working, then create another checkpoint...
git add .
git commit -m "Checkpoint 2: Added API call logic"
```

Repeat this process for every step. You can see your history of checkpoints using `git log --oneline`.

-----

### 3\. Rollback: Return to a Previous Checkpoint ‚è™

If a step goes wrong, you can easily revert your work back to any previous checkpoint.

#### A) Discard Current, Uncommitted Changes

If you just want to undo changes made *after* your last checkpoint, run:

```bash
# Discard all changes in the working directory and revert to the last commit
git restore .
```

#### B) Return to a Specific Previous Checkpoint

If you decide "Checkpoint 2" was a mistake and want to go back to "Checkpoint 1", you need to perform a hard reset.

First, get the commit hash of the checkpoint you want to return to:

```bash
git log --oneline
```

Output might look like this:

```
a1b2c3d Checkpoint 2: Added API call logic
e4f5g6h Checkpoint 1: Initial component structure
i7j8k9l (main) Initial good commit
```

Now, reset your branch to that checkpoint. This will **permanently delete** all checkpoints that came after it.

```bash
# This will destroy Checkpoint 2 and any uncommitted work
git reset --hard e4f5g6h
```

Your branch is now exactly as it was at "Checkpoint 1".

-----

### 4\. Finalize: Combine Checkpoints into One Commit ‚ú®

Once your feature is complete and you're happy with the result, you can combine all your messy "checkpoint" commits into a single, professional commit. This is done with an **interactive rebase**.

1.  Start the interactive rebase process. You want to rebase all the commits you made on your feature branch, so you'll rebase against `main`.

    ```bash
    git rebase -i main
    ```

2.  Your text editor will open with a list of your checkpoint commits, like this:

    ```
    pick e4f5g6h Checkpoint 1: Initial component structure
    pick a1b2c3d Checkpoint 2: Added API call logic
    pick f0e9d8c Checkpoint 3: Fixed styling

    # Rebase i7j8k9l..f0e9d8c onto i7j8k9l (3 commands)
    # ...
    ```

3.  To combine them all into one, keep the first commit as `pick` and change the rest to `squash` or `fixup`.

    * `squash`: Combines the commit's changes and its message.
    * `fixup`: Combines the commit's changes but **discards its message**. This is perfect for temporary checkpoint messages.

    Change the file to look like this:

    ```
    pick e4f5g6h Checkpoint 1: Initial component structure
    fixup a1b2c3d Checkpoint 2: Added API call logic
    fixup f0e9d8c Checkpoint 3: Fixed styling
    ```

4.  Save and close the editor. A new editor window will open, allowing you to write **one, final, clean commit message** for the combined changes. Write a good, descriptive message (e.g., "feat: Implement the new AI-powered idea"), then save and close.

Your `feature/my-new-idea` branch now has just one clean commit on top of `main`.

-----

### 5\. Finish: Merge to Main and Push ‚úÖ

You have two options for finalizing your feature:

#### 5.a Manual Merge (Traditional Approach)

Merge your clean feature branch into `main` and push the result.

```bash
# Switch back to the main branch
git switch main

# Merge your feature branch. --ff-only ensures it's a clean, single-commit addition.
git merge --ff-only feature/my-new-idea

# Push the new commit to your remote repository
git push

# (Optional) Delete your local feature branch
git branch -d feature/my-new-idea
```

#### 5.b Claude Code Assisted Merge (AI-Powered Approach)

Let Claude Code analyze all your changes and create a single, well-crafted commit automatically.

```bash
# Stay on your feature branch
# Claude Code will analyze the diff between main and your current branch
git diff main...HEAD

# Reset to main while keeping all your changes staged
git reset --soft main

# Now all your changes from all checkpoints are staged as one commit
# Ask Claude Code to create the commit by analyzing the staged changes
git status
git diff --cached

# Claude Code will examine:
# - All staged changes
# - The git log history to understand commit patterns
# - The nature of changes (features, fixes, refactoring, etc.)
# Then create an appropriate commit message and commit the changes

# After Claude Code commits, push to remote
git push

# The feature branch is now merged into main as a single clean commit
```

This approach is particularly useful when:
- You have many checkpoint commits that are hard to summarize manually
- You want consistent commit message formatting across your project  
- You want Claude Code to identify the primary purpose and scope of your changes
- You prefer AI assistance in crafting descriptive, conventional commit messages
